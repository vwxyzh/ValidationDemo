# How to validate metadata in markdown files

In markdown file, yaml header will be release as the metadata of the topic.
And some metadata is preserved in `Open Publish`, or `docfx`.
User can write any other metadata in yaml header.

And we also provide a way to validating these metadata.

Branch: `metadata` give the warning to the metadata `mood`.
